## üöß Remaining Work

### High Priority (Required for v1.2.0)
1. **API Endpoint Updates**
   - [ ] Update `/api/games/content-check` to accept hasIssue field

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)
7. **Staff Dashboard Priority Actions**
   - [ ] Add "Games Needing Attention" section
   - [ ] Query games with hasIssue=true for dashboard display

### Testing Before Staging Push
- [ ] Run database migration on staging
- [ ] Test content check creation with toggle ON/OFF
- [ ] Test issue resolution flow
- [ ] Test knowledge badge click on mobile
- [ ] Verify auto-refresh works
- [ ] Check red outline on issue games
- [ ] Verify "Has Issues" filter

## üìù Notes

### Database Migration
**MUST RUN BEFORE DEPLOYING CODE:**
```bash
node scripts/add-has-issue-and-resolution-columns.js
```

### API Changes Required
The `/api/games/content-check` endpoint needs to be updated to accept:
```typescript
{
  // ... existing fields ...
  hasIssue: boolean,
  resolvedById?: string | null,
  resolvedFromCheckId?: string | null
}
```

### Component File Renames
When renaming MissingPiecesInventory:
1. Create new file: `components/features/content-check/IssuesMissingReport.tsx`
2. Update all imports
3. Delete old file after confirming everything works

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

1. [ ] Run database migration on staging
2. [ ] Verify migration successful (check columns exist)
3. [ ] Deploy code to staging
4. [ ] Test all features on staging
5. [ ] Get user approval
6. [ ] Run database migration on production
7. [ ] Deploy to main branch
8. [ ] Verify production deployment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues / TODOs
