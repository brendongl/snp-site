### Database
- PostgreSQL tables created:
  - `play_log_cache` - Caches recent play logs with 1-hour implicit TTL
  - `staff_list` - Caches all staff members from Airtable Staff table
  - Both have proper indexes and comments for documentation

## [1.0.5] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed
- Windows file permission errors when saving image cache metadata
- Implemented fallback error handling for atomic file writes
  - Try atomic rename first (Unix/Linux)
  - Fall back to unlink + rename if that fails
  - Final fallback to direct write if all else fails
- Handles edge case where multiple processes write cache simultaneously

## Architecture Overview

### Cache Management
- **Games Cache**: Latest 337 games with 1-hour TTL
  - Location: `data/games-cache.json`
  - Strategy: Cache-first with Airtable fallback

- **Image Cache**: Board game images with content deduplication
  - Location: `data/images/` and `data/image-cache-metadata.json`
  - Strategy: MD5 content hash + URL hash mapping
  - Features: Handles URL expiry, Windows file locking

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/games` - Get all games with caching
- `POST /api/games/refresh` - Refresh cache (incremental)
- `POST /api/games/refresh?full=true` - Hard refresh (full + image recache)
- `GET /api/images/proxy?url=...` - Proxy and cache image
- `GET /api/content-checks` - Get content check logs
- `GET /api/games/[id]` - Get specific game details

### Version Control
- Always update `lib/version.ts` and `package.json` together
- Semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- Commit messages include version number
- Detailed changelog entries for all releases
