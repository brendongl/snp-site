# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Deployment Strategy
**As of v1.3.0**, this project uses a two-branch deployment model:
- **`staging` branch** - Testing environment (Railway auto-deploys)
- **`main` branch** - Production environment â†’ sipnplay.cafe (Railway auto-deploys)

**All changes (minor/major) go to `staging` first** for testing. Changes are merged to `main` only after user confirmation via "push to main".

## [1.3.5] - 2025-10-20

### Fixed
- **Authentication Using PostgreSQL Cache**: Staging now uses cached staff data instead of Airtable API
  - `POST /api/staff/verify-email` now queries PostgreSQL `staff_list` table
  - Fixes "fetch failed" errors on staging environment
  - Eliminates Airtable API timeout issues during login
  - Staff data must be synced to PostgreSQL via `scripts/sync-staff-to-staging.js` (47 staff members)
  - Requires `DATABASE_URL` environment variable set on Railway

### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL `staff_list` table created via `scripts/create-staff-table.js`
- Staff members synced from Airtable to PostgreSQL (completed in previous deployment)
- `DATABASE_URL` configured on Railway staging environment

### Performance
- Login now queries local PostgreSQL cache instead of Airtable API
- Faster response times for staff authentication
- More reliable on staging with reduced network dependency

## [1.3.4] - 2025-10-20

### Fixed
- **Play Logs API Base ID Correction**: Play Logs table is in SNP Games List base, not Sip N Play base
  - GET /api/play-logs: Now queries correct base (AIRTABLE_GAMES_BASE_ID)
  - POST /api/play-logs: Creates records in correct base
  - DELETE /api/play-logs: Deletes from correct base
  - PATCH /api/play-logs: Updates records in correct base
  - Error "Record ID does not exist" now resolved by using correct base

- **Play Logs Staff Linking Architecture**: Implemented proper multi-base record linking
  - Staff authentication uses Staff table (Sip N Play base)
  - Play Logs "Logged By" links to StaffList table (SNP Games List base)
  - Reason: Airtable cannot link records between different bases
  - `/api/staff/verify-email` now returns both staffId and staffListRecordId
  - Client stores both: `staff_id` (Sip N Play) and `staff_record_id` (SNP Games List)

- **Response Body Reading Error**: Fixed "body stream already read" error in PlayLogDialog
  - Response body can only be read once in Fetch API
  - Now read as text first, then parse JSON for proper error handling

- **Type Safety**: Fixed Next.js 15 route handler params Promise type
  - app/api/games/[id]/edit/route.ts: Updated params type to Promise<{ id: string }>

- **TypeScript Compilation**: Fixed type errors in EditGameDialog.tsx
  - Proper type assertions for parseInt() operations

- **StaffLoginDialog Record ID**: Now correctly stores StaffList record ID
  - Was storing Sip N Play Staff table ID (wrong for Play Logs linking)
  - Now stores StaffList table ID for proper Play Logs linking

### Technical
- Enhanced `app/api/staff/verify-email/route.ts`:
  - Queries Staff table (Sip N Play) for authentication
  - Also queries StaffList table (SNP Games List) to get matching record ID
  - Returns both IDs for different purposes
- Updated `app/auth/signin/page.tsx`:
  - Stores staff_id (Staff table) and staff_record_id (StaffList table)
- Updated `components/features/staff/StaffLoginDialog.tsx`:
  - Stores correct staffListRecordId for Play Logs linking
- Updated `docs/AIRTABLE_SCHEMA.md`:
  - Added critical architecture note: Staff vs StaffList table usage
  - Documented when to use each table for different operations
  - Added complete StaffList table reference

### Documentation
- **CRITICAL NOTE**: Updated schema documentation explaining why StaffList table exists
  - Staff table (Sip N Play): Used for authentication, Type field checking
  - StaffList table (SNP Games List): Used for linked records within SNP Games List base
  - This is a workaround for Airtable's inability to link records between bases

## [1.3.3] - 2025-10-20

### Fixed
- **Admin Detection in StaffLoginDialog**: Fixed critical bug where admin users showed as staff
  - StaffLoginDialog was missing localStorage.setItem for staff_type
  - Both signin page and dialog now correctly store staff_type field

## [1.3.2] - 2025-10-20

### Fixed
- **Staff Table Base Reference**: Changed staff verification to use correct Sip N Play base
  - Was querying games base for staff table (wrong)
  - Now queries Sip N Play base for staff authentication (correct)

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-20

### Fixed
- **Next.js 15 Dynamic Rendering**: Added force-dynamic to signin page
  - Prevents static prerendering that conflicts with useSearchParams()
