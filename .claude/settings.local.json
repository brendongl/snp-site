      "Bash(git commit -m \"$(cat <<''EOF''\nv1.3.6 - Fix: Play Logs, Bulk Create, and Game Edit API issues\n\nFixed three critical bugs:\n\n1. Play Logs API - Record ID mismatch\n   - verify-email endpoint now returns separate IDs for Staff (Sip N Play) and StaffList (SNP Games List)\n   - Play Logs now correctly links to StaffList record ID instead of wrong base\n   - Eliminates Airtable API 422 errors on Play Log creation\n\n2. Bulk Create API - Silent failures\n   - Changed from fail-fast to best-effort approach\n   - Each game record creation is independent with detailed error reporting\n   - Returns which games succeeded/failed with specific Airtable error messages\n\n3. Game Edit API - Not persisting updates\n   - Implemented actual Airtable PATCH request to update game records\n   - Maps all editable fields (name, description, year, players, complexity)\n   - Returns confirmation with updated fields\n\nAlso updated docs/AIRTABLE_SCHEMA.md to clarify Staff Game Knowledge table location.\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",

Content Check API - Payload wrapper fix\n   - Wrapped recordData in { records: [recordData] } for Airtable batch API\n   - Was sending flat object, causing silent failures\n   - Now correctly creates content check records\n\n3. Documentation - 100% accurate schema\n   - Corrected Play Logs \"Logged By\" field documentation\n   - Added critical warning about Staff vs StaffList confusion\n   - Verified with Airtable MCP direct table inspection\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",

Bulk Create API - Missing records wrapper\n   - Was sending flat { fields: {...} } instead of { records: [{ fields: {...} }] }\n   - Airtable batch API requires records array wrapper\n   - Now correctly formatted\n\nVerified all three APIs now use correct Airtable payload format:\n- Play Logs: { records: [{fields: {...}}] } âœ“\n- Content Check: { records: [recordData] } âœ“\n- Bulk Create: { records: [{fields: {...}}] } âœ“\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
