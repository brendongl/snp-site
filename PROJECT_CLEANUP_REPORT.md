# Project Cleanup Report & Recommendations

**Date Generated:** October 20, 2025
**Scope:** Complete codebase audit (25+ API routes, 8 doc files, 13 markdown files, 500+ cached images)
**Status:** Ready for cleanup

---

## Executive Summary

Your project has accumulated **significant technical debt** through:
- **13 markdown files** in root (should be 2-3)
- **Session/status documents** that are now outdated (created 9+ days ago)
- **Duplicate documentation** spread across root and `/docs` directory
- **Empty/unused directories** (`hooks/`, `utils/`)
- **Test screenshots** that don't need to be committed
- **Redundant documentation** with overlapping purposes

**Good News:** Core code is well-organized. The mess is primarily in documentation and config.

---

## Section 1: Outdated & Unnecessary Documentation

### üî¥ DELETE (Outdated Session Notes)

These are historical session summaries that are now stale:

1. **`CATEGORIES_FIX_SUMMARY.md`** - Status: OUTDATED
   - Date: January 16, 2025 (9+ days old)
   - Purpose: One-time setup for BGG categories
   - Action: Already implemented in code
   - Recommendation: **DELETE** - This was a one-time task from January

2. **`SESSION_SUMMARY.md`** - Status: OUTDATED
   - Date: January 16, 2025 (9+ days old)
   - Purpose: Spinner wheel redesign notes
   - Contains: Implementation details from a past session
   - Recommendation: **DELETE** - Archive to git history if needed, not relevant now

3. **`SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-10-16.md`** - Status: OUTDATED
   - Date: October 16, 2025 (4+ days old)
   - Purpose: Expansion filtering system notes
   - Contains: Step-by-step implementation details
   - Recommendation: **DELETE** - Feature already implemented and working

4. **`STATUS.md`** - Status: OUTDATED
   - Date: October 16, 2025 (4+ days old)
   - Purpose: v0.1.0 completion status
   - Current Version: 1.2.0 (not 0.1.0)
   - Recommendation: **DELETE** - Completely superseded by version updates

5. **`MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`** - Status: PARTIALLY OUTDATED
   - Date: October 18, 2025 (2 days old)
   - Purpose: Unraid ‚Üí Railway migration
   - Current Status: Migration already complete
   - Note: Some info is still useful but should be in DEPLOYMENT.md instead
   - Recommendation: **MERGE** into DEPLOYMENT.md, then DELETE

---

### üü° CONSOLIDATE (Redundant Documentation)

These exist in both root and `/docs`:

1. **CHANGELOG.md** (in root)
   - Also exists at: `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
   - Recommendation: **KEEP one, DELETE the other**
   - Choice: Keep in root (users look there first), delete `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

2. **README.md** (in root)
   - Also exists at: `docs/README.md`
   - Recommendation: **KEEP one, DELETE the other**
   - Choice: Keep in root (GitHub shows this), delete `docs/README.md`

---

### üü° OVERLY DETAILED (Too Verbose for Size)

These files are comprehensive but could be better organized:

1. **DEPLOYMENT.md** - 360+ lines
   - Purpose: Complete deployment infrastructure
   - Issue: Mixes architecture, Railway setup, troubleshooting
   - Recommendation: **KEEP but reorganize**
   - Action: Extract troubleshooting to TROUBLESHOOTING.md in docs/

2. **RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md** - 400+ lines
   - Purpose: Step-by-step Railway setup
   - Duplication: Heavy overlap with DEPLOYMENT.md
   - Recommendation: **CONSOLIDATE into single guide**
   - Action: Merge into DEPLOYMENT.md with clearer sections

3. **DOCKER.md** - 200+ lines
   - Purpose: Docker build process
   - Note: Still relevant but rarely needed
   - Recommendation: **KEEP as reference in docs/**

## Section 7: Prevention Rules (For CLAUDE.md)

Add this section to prevent future mess:

```markdown
## Documentation & Project Hygiene

### Documentation Rules
1. **One purpose per file** - Don't mix concerns
2. **No session notes in root** - Archive to git history
3. **No duplicate documentation** - One file per topic
4. **Max 3 top-level .md files** - README, CLAUDE, CHANGELOG
5. **Keep detailed docs in `/docs/`** - Separate from root

### Naming Conventions
- Session notes: Archive branch `sessions/yyyy-mm-dd-topic` or git history
- Status docs: Never commit "STATUS.md" or "SUMMARY.md"
- Summaries: Include only in PR descriptions, not separate files
- Screenshots: Store in `.playwright-mcp/` + add to .gitignore

### File Lifecycle
| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| New feature ‚Üí Use PR description | Don't create FEATURE_SUMMARY.md |
| Session work ‚Üí Summarize in CHANGELOG | Don't create SESSION_SUMMARY.md |
| Historical info ‚Üí Archive to git tags | Don't leave in root |
| Bug fixes ‚Üí Document in code comments | Don't create FIX_SUMMARY.md |

### Root Directory Guidelines
- **Keep in root:**
  - README.md - Project overview
  - CLAUDE.md - Development guide
  - CHANGELOG.md - Version history
  - package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.
  - Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml

- **Move to `/docs/`:**
  - All feature documentation
  - Architecture guides
  - Setup instructions
  - Troubleshooting guides

- **Never commit to root:**
  - Session summaries
  - Status updates
  - Temporary notes
  - Test screenshots
  - .env files or secrets
```

## Section 11: Git Cleanup

### Check Current Git Status

```bash
# See what's tracked
git status

# Check size of repo
git count-objects -v

# Find large objects
git rev-list --objects --all | sort -k 2 | tail -20
```

### After Cleanup

```bash
# Add deletions to staging
git add -A

# Create cleanup commit
git commit -m "v1.2.1 - cleanup: Remove outdated session notes and duplicate docs

- Delete outdated session summaries (CATEGORIES_FIX_SUMMARY.md, etc)
- Delete duplicate documentation (docs/README.md, docs/CHANGELOG.md)
- Add .playwright-mcp screenshots to .gitignore
- Consolidate DEPLOYMENT and MIGRATION_SUMMARY documentation

## Section 14: Why This Matters

### Costs of Current Messiness

1. **Navigation Chaos** - Users don't know which doc to read
2. **Update Burden** - Duplicate docs get out of sync
3. **Onboarding Friction** - New devs spend time sorting through docs
4. **Professional Appearance** - Messy repo signals poor practices
5. **Search Confusion** - Multiple versions of "how to deploy"
6. **Repository Bloat** - Test screenshots add unnecessary size

### Benefits After Cleanup

1. ‚úÖ **Clear Documentation Path** - README ‚Üí CLAUDE ‚Üí docs/*
2. ‚úÖ **Single Source of Truth** - One file per topic
3. ‚úÖ **Better Onboarding** - New devs know where to look
4. ‚úÖ **Professional Quality** - Clean repo, clean documentation
5. ‚úÖ **Easy Maintenance** - Updates in one place only
6. ‚úÖ **Smaller Repository** - Faster clones, cleaner history

---

## Section 15: Prevention Going Forward

### New Guidelines for CLAUDE.md

**When you add new documentation:**
1. Ask: "Does a file already exist for this?"
2. Ask: "Will this be outdated soon?"
3. Ask: "Should this be in the code comments instead?"
4. Ask: "Is this root-level or docs/-level?"

**New Feature Workflow:**
- Feature PR: Describe in PR body (not a new file)
- After merge: Update CLAUDE.md/feature docs if needed
- Never create: SESSION_SUMMARY.md, STATUS.md, SUMMARY.md

**Bug Fix Workflow:**
- Fix PR: Document the fix in code comments
- After merge: Update TROUBLESHOOTING.md if applicable
- Never create: A separate fix summary file

**Session Work:**
- Work locally, commit regularly to branches
- Summarize work in git commit messages
- Archive detailed notes to git history, not root files

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review** this report
2. **Create backup branch** (safety first!)
3. **Execute Phase 1** (delete outdated docs)
4. **Execute Phase 2** (consolidate)
5. **Execute Phase 3-5** (code cleanup)
6. **Update CLAUDE.md** (prevention rules)
7. **Commit** all changes
8. **Verify build** passes

---

**Report Generated:** October 20, 2025
**Estimated Cleanup Time:** 45 minutes
**Risk Level:** Low (only docs and empty dirs)
**Backup Recommended:** Yes ‚úÖ
