⬜ Get fridge light fixed, or replace fridge with larger one and sell ours
        Notes: Our fridge is the 2nd tallest in the Sanaky range. We can get a taller fridge to pre more things in.





Get the avg 2nd hand price for ours vs the price of a new taller model. Comment with the approximate total cost for this task.



Find a buyer for ours and buy a new one on the same day and transfer all drinks.

Keep in mind the fridge has to be lifted over the bar counter, so everything at the pos area needs to be removed.
⬜ Brainstorm KPI for Manager Commision Incentives
        ⬜ A loyalty program with loyalty points that customers can spend on things or get discounts. The total number of points spent monthly can be used as KPI
        Notes: Previously with Mike during the early tenor, he had commisions based on overall growth of gross revenue.

Later, we figured out that metric is not really inline with his work ethic and should naturally grow through my efforts creating events, upgrading menus, etc.

I want to create some KPI's where its YOUR effort which is visible AND is profitable for the profit margin of the shop.

Idea 1 - Specific Category Sales

Sales of retail stock, hot-food, and 6-day passes are inlign with store growth and custom retention. So far the staff have 0 iniative to actually upsell these things as they get paid either way.

Idea 2 - Creation of new store events and promotions

We are dead during the weekday. g2 is wasted space and needs to be utilised better. If you are up to the task of creating and managing some events which brings people in the door, you can get commisions based directly off how profitable and well they are doing.

Idea 3 - Reoccuring Bookings for specific groups and organisations

We can convert the space into anything which is needed. People need a place to do arts and crafts, theatre, staff team building, corporate meetings. If you can get a client which does repeat bookings at our cafe during off-peak hours, you will receive some commisions based on those bookings.
